## Overview

**HireOn.AI** is an intelligent career platform built exclusively for **job seekers**, not recruiters. We empower you to stand out in a crowded job market by offering **AI-driven CV feedback**, **automatic cover letter generation**, and **personalized job recommendations**.

Unlike traditional job boards, we don‚Äôt just aggregate listings, we deeply understand your unique strengths and career goals, providing a truly personalized experience that accelerates your journey from application to opportunity. Because finding a job shouldn‚Äôt feel like a fulltime job ‚Äî it should feel like your next big step.

## üìä Background

According to [Statistics Indonesia (BPS), August 2024](https://data.goodstats.id/statistic/persentase-sarjana-pengangguran-di-ri-meningkat-dua-kali-lipat-selama-1-dekade-terakhir-9ah2d), **842,378 university graduates are unemployed**, making up **11.28%** of the total 7.47 million unemployed individuals in Indonesia. This highlights a critical gap: many **fresh graduates struggle** to align their skills and experience with industry demands, underscoring the urgent need for solutions that bridge this disconnect.

**Key challenges include:**
- Mismatch between degrees and job opportunities  
- Unstructured and unclear job listings  
- Career guidance that feels generic, not personal
- Inadequate support in crafting CVs and cover letters  
- Career switches by 60% of Indonesian workers, reflecting the need for adaptable pathways ([Jakpat, 2016](https://insight.jakpat.net/its-time-to-roll-survey-report-on-indonesians-switching-job-habit/))

## üèóÔ∏è System Design

This system design outlines the **architecture of HireOn.AI**, the frontend combining a React + Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI, deployed via Google Cloud Run. The backend, built with Node.js + Hapi.js, exposes secured APIs using JWT tokens and manages data storage with MongoDB Atlas and Google Cloud Storage (Object Storage). Core ML services are containerized in Docker and served through Google Cloud Platform, using Vertex AI Gemini Flash 2.5 for CV analysis, job matching, and personalized cover letter generation. The job recommendation engine utilizes Chroma vector search with Gecko-2 embeddings for high-precision semantic matching. Job data is enriched through scheduled scraping, categorized jobs and salary-estimated via a TensorFlow NLP model. This processed data is then used by downstream services to improve relevance and personalization.
