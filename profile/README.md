# 🎯 HireOn.AI : Always on for your career

## 📊 Background

According to data from **Statistics Indonesia (BPS) as of August 2024**, the number of unemployed university graduates in Indonesia has reached **842,378 people**, or approximately **11.28%** of the total national unemployment figure of 7.47 million. This highlights a growing gap between the increasing number of educated job seekers and the labor market's ability to absorb them.

Key challenges faced by job seekers include:
- Mismatch between educational background and industry needs.
- Incomplete and unstructured job information.
- Difficulty adapting to industry standards.
- Lack of support in preparing essential documents such as **CVs** and **cover letters**.

More than **60% of workers** in Indonesia have undergone a *career switch* (Jakpat, 2016), largely driven by a disconnect between their college majors and the job opportunities available in the market.

## 💡 Our Solution

We are building an **AI-powered intelligent job platform** designed to:

- 🔍 **Aggregate job vacancies** from multiple job portals.
- 💰 Provide **salary range predictions** and **job classification**.
- 🎯 Match user skills with job descriptions.
- 📄 Analyze and score users’ **CVs**.
- 💌 Generate personalized **cover letters** automatically.

Our core objectives are to:
- Reduce the mismatch between job seekers and available jobs.
- Simplify and personalize the job search process.
- Deliver clearer, more transparent, and structured job information.
